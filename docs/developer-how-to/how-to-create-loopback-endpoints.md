## How to create a Loopback Endpoint Pair





> Note: Virtual Loopback Endpoint Pairs are not currently visible to the WinMM MIDI 1.0 API. There are complexities with that API when devices are added and removed at runtime. It's possible these devices will never be visibile to WinMM MIDI 1.0. For full functionality, we recommend using the new Windows MIDI Services SDK.

## Sample Code
