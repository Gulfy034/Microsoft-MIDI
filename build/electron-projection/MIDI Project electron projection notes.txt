Modified from this project
https://github.com/MaySoMusician/NodeRT/tree/feature/136-vs2019

Assuming you have winget installed

winget install nodejs
or download from https://nodejs.org/en

npm install npm@latest -g

npm install node-gyp -g

in windows environment variables (so they are global)
LIBPATH = C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\UnionMetadata\10.0.20348.0

npm config edit
	add a line which says:
	msvs_version=2022


nodert\src\NodeRTCmd\bin\Debug\NodeRTCmd.exe --winmd ..\staging\api\x64\Windows.Devices.Midi2.winmd --outdir .\projection

open the build/binding solution

In VS C++ project, for all configurations, update the AdditionalUsingDirectories property to include
%Program Files (x86)%\Windows Kits\10\UnionMetadata\10.0.20348.0

copy Windows.Devices.Midi2.winmd to projection\windows.devices.midi2\build
copy Windows.winmd from the unionmetadata to same folder

copy C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Preview\Common7\IDE\VC\vcpackages platform.winmd to same folder


Comment out SendSingleMessageStruct body and reference
Comment out SendMultipleMessagesStructList
Comment out SendMultipleMessagesStructArray

Open binding.sln in VS and recompile in BOTH debug and release


binding.gyp

      ["WIN_VER==\"v10\"", {
        "msvs_settings": {
          "VCCLCompilerTool": {
            "AdditionalUsingDirectories": [
              "%ProgramFiles(x86)%/Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0/VC/lib/store/references",
              "%ProgramFiles%/Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0/VC/lib/store/references",
              "%ProgramFiles(x86)%/Windows Kits/10/UnionMetadata/10.0.20348.0",
              "$(VCToolsInstallDir)/lib/x86/store/references",
              "%MIDI_REPO_ROOT%/build/release/api/"
            ]
          }
        }
      }],


download 
npm pack @nodert-win11/windows.data.json
npm pack @nodert-win11/windows.devices.midi
npm pack @nodert-win11/windows.devices.enumeration

unzip them, copy to appropriate folders under node_modules, and then make these changes:

 (this change needs to be made in binding.gyp in ALL downloaded packages as well or you need to download and install 10.0.22000 sdk, or whatever version the binding.gyp specifies)

      ["USE_ADDITIONAL_WINMD==\"true\"", {
        "msvs_settings": {
          "VCCLCompilerTool": {
            "AdditionalUsingDirectories": [
              "%ProgramFiles%/Windows Kits/10/UnionMetadata/10.0.20348.0",
              "%ProgramFiles%/Windows Kits/10/Include/10.0.20348.0/um",
              "%ProgramFiles(x86)%/Windows Kits/10/UnionMetadata/10.0.20348.0",
              "%ProgramFiles(x86)%/Windows Kits/10/Include/10.0.20348.0/um"
            ]
          }
        }
      }]



copy windows.devices.midi2 folder from projection to node_modules in sample

To deal with mismatch node_module versions:
https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/using-native-node-modules

in projection microsoft.windows.devices.midi2 and all similar folders:

in electron sample folder
npm install --save-dev electron
npm install --save-dev @electron/rebuild
node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild

Then do the same for each app. After the npm install commands, you'll need to re-copy the windows.devices.midi2 folder into node_modules

from electron-midi-sample folder
npm start to run
